**Use Child Theme**: Add child theme support to any WordPress theme (Crear Tema Hijo para trabajar de manera segura)

### What problem does this solve?
If you make changes to a theme, those changes will be lost when the theme is updated.
With a child theme, your changes are kept separate, so the parent theme can be safely updated.

### How it works

* If a child theme is not active, the user will see a WP notice with an "Activate" link **on the Theme Editor screen**
* When clicked, a child theme is created (if needed) and enabled

### Setup

If you're a theme developer, include `use-child-theme.php` in your theme, then add this code into functions.php:

```php
require_once( trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'use-child-theme.php' );
```
